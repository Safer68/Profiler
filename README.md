## Name

Choose a self-explaining name for your project.

## Description

Let people know what your project can do specifically. Provide context and add a link to any reference visitors might be
unfamiliar with. A list of Features or a Background subsection can also be added here. If there are alternatives to your
project, this is a good place to list differentiating factors.

## Installation

Within a particular ecosystem, there may be a common way of installing things, such as using Yarn, NuGet, or Homebrew.
However, consider the possibility that whoever is reading your README is a novice and would like more guidance. Listing
specific steps helps remove ambiguity and gets people to using your project as quickly as possible. If it only runs in a
specific context like a particular programming language version or operating system or has dependencies that have to be
installed manually, also add a Requirements subsection.

1. Get code from repository

```
cd existing_repo
git remote add origin https://git.it-academy.by/bootcamp/dev.git
